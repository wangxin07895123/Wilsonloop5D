## Wilson loops, Holomorphic Anomaly Equations and Blowup Equations

This repository contains research data associated with the paper [arXiv:2305.09171](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09171) titled "Wilson loops, Holomorphic Anomaly Equations and Blowup Equations". The information includes:

1. **BPS Sectors for Local $\mathbb{P}^2$ and Local $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$**: These amplitudes are relevant to the BPS sector in genus $(n,g)$, representation $\mathsf{n}$ and can be found in the [P2](https://github.com/wangxin07895123/Wilsonloop5D/tree/main/P2) and [P1P1](https://github.com/wangxin07895123/Wilsonloop5D/tree/main/P1P1) directories. The data are stored with the naming convention `ZWgB3[\mathsf{n},{n,g}]`.

2. **Expression of $\mathcal{Z}_{\mu_1\mu_2}(M_j,M_k)$**: The expression for this mathematical function can be found within [Zmu1mu2Q_10.zip](https://github.com/wangxin07895123/Wilsonloop5D/blob/main/Zmu1mu2Q_10.zip). The format is `Zmu1mu2Q[$\mu_1$, $\mu_2$]`.
